In this code:

The #container element has a margin of 20px and a relative positioning to serve as the reference for absolute positioning of the pseudo-elements.
The ::before and ::after pseudo-elements are used to insert content before and after the #container element, respectively.
The content property is used to specify the text to be displayed.
color is set to #f00 for red color.
font-size is set to 20px for the font size of the inserted content.
position: absolute; is used to position the pseudo-elements.
left: -120px; and right: -120px; are used to adjust the position of 'before' and 'after' text, respectively. You can adjust the values based on your layout requirements.
Ensure that this CSS code is in your styles.css file, and it should create the desired layout with special text displayed before and after the container.
